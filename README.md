## what even is this

a sports webapp to display live scores, news, player data etc.
mainly making this for myself for fun so i can have a lightweight, sports widget displaying on my desktop (i switched to linux)


## technologies used
tauri - low overhead webapps, so i can have it permanently running as a widget in my waybar (yes i use hyprland, i use arch btw...)
next.js - it's what i know + it's fun to use

## api?
im using ESPN's hidden api, you can access it the docs here: [Github]https://github.com/pseudo-r/Public-ESPN-API

## why????
i'm bored and i wanted to make something for once + needed a break from learning game dev
